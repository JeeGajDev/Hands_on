/**
 * Some important concurrent API enhancements are:
 * 
 * ConcurrentHashMap compute(), forEach(), forEachEntry(), forEachKey(),
 * forEachValue(), merge(), reduce() and search() methods. CompletableFuture
 * that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status). Executors
 * newWorkStealingPool() method to create a work-stealing thread pool using all
 * available processors as its target parallelism level.
