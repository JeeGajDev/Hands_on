	 * 
	 * We have already seen forEach() method and Stream API for collections. Some
	 * new methods added in Collection API are:
	 * 
	 * Iterator default method forEachRemaining(Consumer action) to perform the
	 * given action for each remaining element until all elements have been
	 * processed or the action throws an exception. Collection default method
	 * removeIf(Predicate filter) to remove all of the elements of this collection
	 * that satisfy the given predicate. Collection spliterator() method returning
	 * Spliterator instance that can be used to traverse elements sequentially or
	 * parallel. Map replaceAll(), compute(), merge() methods. Performance
	 * Improvement for HashMap class with Key Collisions
